# RentForMe is a project inspired by AirBnB

## Built with html5, css3 and react;

## Additional tools/libraries include react-calender, framer-motion, react-router, react-icons.

## About the program

### it is a website that makes finding an apartment to rent easy, anyone can visit the page and find an apartment in their state of choice(if available), check out its perks and decide whether or not to rent it and for how long using the react calender date range. The bookmark and pagination feature are also avaliable. 

### Home owners/Landlords can put up their houses too to find tenants.

### I created all the data contained in this program by getting random photos of houses off the internet and coming up with ficticious names, e.g, the house names, names of landlords, phone number...

### I hope to improve this program in the future by: making the data dynamic, appending the data gotten from the LandLord form to the data displayed on the main display.
